NOTES:
NOTICE: You've installed GitLab Runner without the ability to use 'docker in docker'.
The GitLab Runner chart (gitlab/gitlab-runner) is deployed without the `privileged` flag by default for security purposes. 
This can be changed by setting `gitlab-runner.runners.privileged` to `true`. Before doing so, please read the GitLab Runner chart's documenation on why we
chose not to enable this by default. See https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/install/kubernetes.html#running-docker-in-docker-containers-with-gitlab-runners

WARNING: If you are upgrading from a previous version of the GitLab Helm Chart, there is a major upgrade to the included PostgreSQL chart, which requires manual steps be performed. Please see our upgrade documentation for more information: https://docs.gitlab.com/charts/installation/upgrade.html
